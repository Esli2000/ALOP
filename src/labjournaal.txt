DATA
Exoplanet WASP-43b: B filter (TA: Willem)
determine the transit duration and depth and relate that to the properties of the planet

Once you manage to get into the servers, you can get to the datasets which are located in the following path. You can access this through the cd (change directory) command

Important! Copy the files to /data1/[username]/ or /data2/[username]/ (bachelor servers) using a command like “cp” or “cp -r” (for entire directories). You should always leave the original files and tinker with a copy. This is good practice in general, and since multiple groups are working with the same dataset it is even more important now. Only copy files for your target: /disks/galpop2/ALOP2020dataRW/WASP43

Things to think about. What does "master" mean? Why is building a master flat really important (this is in fact one of the most crucial steps for precise photometry)? When are the flats taken (i.e., at what time, night? day? twilight?)? Have a look at the individual flat ("sky background") images with DS9.

flats during both evening and morning twilight
master = to correct for nonuniformity CCD

ANALYSIS
Quick overview of the procedure:

1a. Double check which filter you have to work with. Note that all science frames for the transits were taken using windowing. Look up the INT WFC manual to understand what windowing is (why do we use windowing for exoplanet transits?).
reduce readout time, such that measurements become time resolved
done

1b. Check the observing logs for issues, see the run_log_2018MMDD.int file. There is a lot of useful information in there and is gives an overview what is in all the files (filters used, target names, etc)
done, see below




2. You need to make a master Bias frame yourself in python. There are windowed and non-windowed bias frames (windowing the CCD affects the bias level). Do both, because we will need both (non-windowed for master flat and windowed for science).
done

3. You need to make a master Flat frame yourself in python (pick the correct filter!). The flats were taken in normal (non-windowed) mode.
a) Therefore they need to be corrected first with the non-windowed master bias.
done

b) Then the Flats needs to be windowed manually to match image layout of the science science frames. Note that the flat frames are called "Sky background" in the log files.
done

4. Correct your science with the master Flat (manually windowed) and Bias (from the windowed bias frames).

PROCEDURE

ssh -X [username]@bach2.strw.leidenuniv.nl (bach1 did not have sufficient device space for copying data)
*ww*
cp -r /disks/galpop2/ALOP2020dataRW/WASP43 /data2/[username]/
*lang wachten*
*done*
ds9 *to check files for instance*

besef: er was 1 slechte bias, stond in de log, die is al verwijderd voor ons zie ik
besef: we hebben geen dark (niet nodig: CCD wordt gekoeld)

exptimes in seconden
t_flat = [129.960, 20.060, 13.080, 9.080, 7.070] # exptime niet hetzelfde
t_science = ...

besef: we hebben exptime niet nodig, omdat we geen dark hebben, volgens mij

bias en 'science' wat ik noem light windowed
NWINDOWS=                    1 / Number of readout windows                      
WINSEC1 = '[800:1200,1800:2200], disabled  ' / Readout window 1 (d-space)       
WINSEC2 = '[0:0,0:0], disabled             ' / Readout window 2 (d-space)       
WINSEC3 = '[0:0,0:0], disabled             ' / Readout window 3 (d-space)       
WINSEC4 = '[668:1623,1642:2648], enabled   ' / Readout window 4 (d-space) <--- this one
alle hetzelfde gewindowed (gelukkig maar)

useful terminal commands:
cd .. or cd ~ or ...
ls
pwd
rm <file>
cp -r <folder>
mkdir <folder>
ls -1 | wc -l #to count files in dir
